            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits
                and comes in many forms. Formal education happens in a complex institutional framework, like public
                schools. Non-formal education is also structured but takes place outside the formal schooling system
                while informal education is unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal and non-formal
                education are divided into levels that include early childhood education, primary education, secondary
                education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on the teaching method, like
                teacher-centered and student-centered education, and on the subject, like science education, language
                education, and physical education. The term "education" can also refer to the mental states and
                qualities of educated people and the academic field studying educational phenomena.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The precise definition of education is disputed and there are
                disagreements about what the aims of education are and to what extent education is different from
                indoctrination by fostering critical thinking. These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and
                improve forms of education. Fundamentally, education socializes children into society by teaching
                cultural values and norms. It equips them with the skills needed to become productive members of
                society. This way, it stimulates economic growth and raises awareness of local and global problems.
                Organized institutions affect many aspects of education. For example, governments set education policies
                to determine when school classes happen, what is taught, and who can or must attend. International
                organizations, like UNESCO, have been influential in promoting primary education for all children.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The definition of education has been explored by theorists from various
                fields.[1] Many agree that education is a purposeful activity aimed at achieving goals like the
                transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits.[2] There is extensive debate regarding its
                exact nature beyond these general features. One approach views education as a process that occurs during
                events such as schooling, teaching, and learning.[3] Another outlook understands education not as a
                process but as the mental states and dispositions of educated persons that result from this process.[4]
                Additionally, the term may also refer to the academic field that studies the methods, processes, and
                social institutions involved in teaching and learning.</p>
